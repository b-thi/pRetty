**List of graphs that we would like to make:**

1) Heatmap (perhaps multiple versions for other variables?)
2) Web Graph
3) Area Plots
4) Graph like this: http://flipflopflyin.com/flipflopflyball/info-ageofyankees.html
5) Facet-Wrapped Heat Map (i.e repeated heatmaps over some categorical variable)
6) Some sick looking bar plot
7) Some sick looking box plot
8) Not sure what else
